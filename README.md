# Scheduling Algorithms

This repository contains implementations and evaluations of various CPU scheduling algorithms in Python, along with average turnaround time (TAT), average waiting time (WT), and graphs for visualization.

## Algorithms Implemented

1. **First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)**
2. **Round Robin (RR)**
3. **Shortest Job First (SJF)**
4. **Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF)**
5. **Priority Scheduling (Preemptive)**
6. **Priority Scheduling (Non-Preemptive)**

## Common Terms

- **AT (Arrival Time):** Time at which a process arrives in the ready queue.
- **BT (Burst Time or Service Time):** Time required by a process for CPU execution.
- **FT (Finish Time):** Time at which a process completes its execution.
- **TAT (Turnaround Time):** Total time taken by a process from arrival to completion.
- **WT (Waiting Time):** Time for which a process remains in the ready queue waiting for execution.

## Output

Each algorithm is evaluated based on the provided input data, and the following metrics are calculated and displayed:

- Average Turnaround Time (TAT)
- Average Waiting Time (WT)

## Graphs

Graphs are generated to visualize the performance of each scheduling algorithm:

## Usage

1. add <input_data_excel_sheet> into your drive:
2. open <Scheduling_Algorithms_file> in colab: 
3. Install dependencies (if any):
4. Run algorithm implementation to generate results.
